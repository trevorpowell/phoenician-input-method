# Phoenician/Paleo-Hebrew Input Method
Unicode input method for typing in Phoenician/Paleo-Hebrew on Mac

# Key Mapping
The key mapping for the input method matches the letters of the Phoenician/Paleo-Hebrew alphabet to their corresponding Hebrew letters on the standard Hebrew keyboard layout. Where letters have different final forms in Hebrew, those letters are duplicated in this layout.
